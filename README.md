Permutation is used to calculate all possible states of a set of numbers or letters or any other type of list. For example, if we want the number of states of the letters "abcd", provided that these letters are placed two by two, we will have these 12 states:

  ab
  
  ac
  ad
  
  ba
  bc
  
  bd
  ca
  
  cb
  
  cd
  
  da
  
  db
  
  dc

In this code, we must first enter the required number of words and all the letters and numbers that we want to calculate permutation. Then the program creates a file named a combination of entries and all possible words are stored in this file. 
Using itertools in this application, this program needs cmd or terminal to run.
